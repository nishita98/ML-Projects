# ML-Projects

These machine-learning projects and concepts were studied and built in my respective modules.

ML project: This project aims to perform a classification task using machine learning. The classification task consists of classifying news articles into the correct topical category using SVC, Logistic Regression, and deep learning.

bts_dataset_word2vec: This project aims to analyze and interpret some meaningful information from the data using gensim Word2Vec algorithm.

correlation_btw_scores: The code analyzes the relationship/ correlation between the MMI and WEMWBS scores using Pearson correlation.

effect_texting_while_driving: The code analyzes the effect of the texting function(texting while driving) on the control function(driving) using a T-test.
